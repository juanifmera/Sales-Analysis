🌟 What's Inside?

Data Aggregation & Preparation 📊
We start by merging multiple sales data files into a single dataset and performing initial cleaning:

File Merging: Combine data from multiple CSV files into one cohesive dataset.
Data Cleaning: Remove any rows with missing values and correct formatting issues.
Feature Extraction: Extract the month from the order date and convert relevant columns to numeric types for analysis.
Key Features:

Monthly Sales Analysis: Compute total sales for each month and visualize it in a bar chart.
City-wise Sales Analysis: Identify which US cities generated the highest sales and display the results in a horizontal bar chart.

Visualizing Sales Trends 📉
This section focuses on various visualizations to uncover sales patterns:

Sales Per Month: A bar chart showing total sales for each month, highlighting seasonal trends.
Sales Per City: A horizontal bar chart illustrating the total sales for each city, identifying top-performing locations.

Advanced Insights 🕵️‍♂️
Dive deeper into the data to gain more actionable insights:

Hourly Sales Analysis: Determine the best times of day for a marketing campaign by analyzing sales patterns across different hours. A line plot shows sales trends throughout the day, helping to optimize promotional activities.
